# Tnet Web Portal

Developed for Toshiba Machine, Chennai for their injection moulding machines

Tnet is a web portal designed to help customers view their machine data in an intuitive web interface.
Users can segregate their machines by Factories and Shopfloors.
Administrators can add normal accounts with view-only priveleges.

Uses MySQL, Node.js with Express and a bit of AngularJS for the frontend. 
Part of my summer internship at Toshiba Machine, Chennai.
